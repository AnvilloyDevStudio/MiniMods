MiniMods Software License Agreement

Copyright (C), 2023 Anvilloy Dev Studio
Everyone is permitted to copy, mention or embed this license document when using this software, but modification of contents is not allowed.
This license is only applicable for this software, or library, including the uses of this.

Preamble & Complementation of License

This software or library, MiniMods, is managed by the host or organization, Anvilloy Dev Studio. While this software is open-sourced, a corresponding license is made. As described in the original README file included in the software source GitHub repository, this software is targeting to expand the experience with the game Minicraft+. The details of both projects would not be mentioned in this document. However, while this library would be used for further uses, such as "modding" (the act of modification to the targeting game) with this library, permissions should still be explicitly described as being a public open-source software. Although this organization may not force you to follow all the terms and restrictions being described below by legal acts, compliance with the terms is still suggested as being a responsive user.

In general, permissions of behaviours of copying, redistribution and modification are explicitly described in the GNU Lesser Library Public License, version 2.1, which is the general license of this software used for the source code. While the licensee is using this software, further more terms restricting the users are described in the terms which are described in another document apart from this license document.

There is also GNU Library Public License applied to distributions of the modified version of Minicraft+ Java executable file (Java ARchive), including the patch files included in the source code but applied directly to the source code of Minicraft+ JAR file in the distributions, and source codes within the directory named "minicraft" from the repository's root directory.

This license is automatically activated by users using or downloading the distributions in any form, and the users are regarded as the licensees under this license.

This is the END of license complementation by the organization. The capture of the LGNU and GPL licenses applied is included in the same directory of the GitHub repository or the source code named "LICENSE-LGPL" and "LICENSE-GPL" respectively.
